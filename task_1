***Private Key*** is used to both encrypt and decrypt the data and is shared between the sender and receiver of encrypted data. The ***public key*** is only used to encrypt data and to decrypt the data, the ***private key*** is used and is shared. ... The ***public key*** is free to use and the ***private key*** is kept secret only.

## Task

You can create a new public and private key pair with the following command:

{{ i }}
```
yum install openssh-clients -y
ssh-keygen
```
{{ i }}

Press the Enter or Return key to accept the default location. Enter and re-enter a passphrase when prompted, or
leave it empty.

After you generate an SSH key, you can check to see if you have any existing SSH keys.
List the contents of your ~/.ssh directory:

{{ i }}
```
$ ls -al ~/.ssh
# Lists all the files in your ~/.ssh directory
```
{{ i }}

PCheck the directory listing to see if you already have a public SSH key. By default the filenames of the public keys are one of the following:

{{ i }}
```
id_dsa.pub
id_ecdsa.pub
id_ed25519.pub
id_rsa.pub
```
{{ i }}

Ensure your SSH key is added to the ssh-agent. Start the ssh-agent in the background if it's not already running:

{{ i }}
```
 eval $(ssh-agent -s)
 ```
{{ i }}

Add you SSH key to the ssh-agent. Notice that you'll need te replace id_rsa in the command with the name of your
**private key file**:

{{ i }}
```
 ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
 ```
{{ i }}

Copied to the clipboard your public key.
{{ i }}
```
cat .ssh/id_rsa.pub
```
{{ i }}
