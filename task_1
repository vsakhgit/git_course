***Private Key*** is used to both encrypt and decrypt the data and is shared between the sender and receiver of encrypted data. The ***public key*** is only used to encrypt data and to decrypt the data, the ***private key*** is used and is shared. ... The ***public key*** is free to use and the ***private key*** is kept secret only.



- You can create a new public and private key pair with the following command:

```
yum install openssh-clients -y
ssh-keygen
```


- Press the Enter or Return key to accept the default location. Enter and re-enter a passphrase when prompted, or
leave it empty.

- After you generate an SSH key, you can check to see if you have any existing SSH keys.
List the contents of your ~/.ssh directory:

```
$ ls -al ~/.ssh
# Lists all the files in your ~/.ssh directory
```

- PCheck the directory listing to see if you already have a public SSH key. By default the filenames of the public keys are one of the following:

```
id_dsa.pub
id_ecdsa.pub
id_ed25519.pub
id_rsa.pub
```

- Ensure your SSH key is added to the ssh-agent. Start the ssh-agent in the background if it's not already running:

```
 eval $(ssh-agent -s)
```

- Add you SSH key to the ssh-agent. Notice that you'll need te replace id_rsa in the command with the name of your
**private key file**:

```
 ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```


Copied to the clipboard your public key.

```
cat .ssh/id_rsa.pub
```

After go to https://github.com/ than:

- Paste the SSH key into the Key field.
- Add a descriptive text in the title, something that will define you as a user or the computer it is used from.
- Click Add Key. A new public key was added to your account
